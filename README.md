### What is [airclough.com](https://airclough.com)?

airclough.com is a React application that leverages many of the software tools currently in my repertoire. Simply put, I needed something to link on my resume.

### Why airclough?

[fairclough.com](https://www.fairclough.com/) was taken. And honestly, being put to better use than anything I could do with it. First stop I'm making if I ever need a new sail boat cover. Also, MJ is one of my all-time favorite athletes so the play on Air Jordan is fitting.

### Where are the tests, bro? üßê

## Tools

* __ESLint__ - For all your linting needs.

* __Next.js__ - The React framework for production. Took that tagline direct from their site. Couldn't agree more.

* __React__ - The standard. Have been using React as my go-to front-end library, nearly since its inception. Have also worked with any and all other JS libraries you can name. Vue? Sure. Backbone? Yup. Angular? ...*Angular?*

* __Redux__ - Preferred global state management tool. Total overkill for this project. Just wanted to demonstrate familiarity with it. React context or a simple global object would have sufficed.

* __Sass__ - Preferred CSS extension library.

* __TypeScript__ - Strongly typed JS has grown on me. TS CLI tool also works as a great abstraction layer over compilation to ES2021 and beyond.

* __Vercel__ - Current deployment tool flavor of choice. The branch previews are incredible for team workflows. Have also deployed React applications on Netlify, S3 and EC2 in the past.

*This code was written over the course of a weekend with the sole purpose of putting my fly as hell JS skills on display to the world-- Wide web.*
