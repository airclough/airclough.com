### What is [airclough.com](https://airclough.com)?

[airclough.com](https://airclough.com) is a React application that leverages many of the software tools and packages currently at my disposal.

### Why airclough?

[fairclough.com](https://www.fairclough.com/) was taken- And honestly, being put to better use than anything I could possibly do with it. First stop I'm making if I ever need a new sail boat cover. Also, MJ is the üêê and one of my all-time favorite athletes, so the play on Air Jordan is fitting.

### Where are the tests, bro? üßê
